    "text_data": "The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. It involves processes such as evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and runoff, all of which play a crucial role in maintaining the planet's water supply. Water evaporates from oceans, lakes, and rivers, rises into the atmosphere, condenses into clouds, and falls back to the Earth as precipitation. This water then flows into rivers and oceans, where the cycle begins again. The water cycle is a vital natural process that helps regulate the Earth's climate and provides freshwater for plants, animals, and human activities."
